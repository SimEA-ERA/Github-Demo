# Github-Demo

The purpose of this repo is to showcase how to use `Github` and `git`.

1. Clone repository somewhere locally
2. Change a file, e.g., README file
3. `git add <file>` or `git add .` 
4. `git commit -m "Some comments"`
5. `git push origin <branch_name>


## Working on different branches
1. Create your branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
2. See all branches: `git branch -a`
3. Fetch all branches: `git fetch -all`
